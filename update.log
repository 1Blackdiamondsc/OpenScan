  - UNIFIED USER INTERFACE for OpenScan Classic & Mini
  It is highly recommended to change to the new Interface via the Start Tab
  (you can always go back to this version)
  Please let me know, if there are any issues: info@openscan.eu

2020-08-28-10.45
  - added simplified User Interface (can switch at any time via Update&Info Menu)
 ----SIMPLIFIED USER INTERFACE FOR THE OPENSCAN AND ESPECIALLY OPENSCAN MINI----
  - added menu on startscreen
  - added pre-defined routines (dropdown: Load Programs)
  - added wifi-connection form in Settings Sub-menu
  - added Button "Change to Expert GUI"
  - added Button "Model: OpenScan Mini or OpenScan"
  - added dropdown to choose the camera model (instead of setting the resolution manually)
  - changed file explorer has now its own sub-menu (in preparation of the cloud-processing :))
  - changed orientation of the preview
  - changed color-theme :)
  - removed openscan-cloud sub menu (as it was not used very much and would need quite some improvement)
  - removed camera-brightness slider (and instead fixed this value at 50)
  - removed camera-contrast slider (and instead fixed this value at 0)
  - removed external camera, bluetooth, smartphone camera

2020-04-25-17.17
  - added: larger preview window
  - added: popup, when a new update is available
  - added: tooltips (when moving mouse over buttons/switches)
  - improved: increased the preview speed to 1 photo/sec (instead of 0.5/s)
  - fixed: conflict between auto-update and get features

2020-04-08-23.36
  - added: feature detection - this will mark all the features that the software
  will see in an image and mark those with green dots. This helps spotting critical
  areas before taking a larger photo set. Note: This is a cloud functionality and
  the preview image will be transmitted and processed on my server.

2020-04-03-14.39
  - added: feedback-option, where you can upload an image set to my server
    and get feedback on the image quality & routine settings via email. This
    process is currently done manually and thus might take one or two days :)

2020-03-19-17.26
  - replaced: zoom with crop
  - added: crop x and y to reduce filesize
  - added: acceleration ramp for smoother movement
  - added: experimental mode (see settings & camera)
  - added: hotspot-mode for Raspberry Pi Camera (experimental)
  - added: settings- acceleration + acceleration ramp
  - added: settings- define angle for manual motor movement
  - added: confirmation box before installing new version
  - changed: manual will be downloaded automatically (when check updates
    is pressed)
  - changed: code clean-up :)
  - fixed: sometimes the ringlight did not turn off on shutdown/stayed on
    after boot
  - fixed: english user manual has not been reachable before
  - removed: German user manual (I am really sorry, but keeping only the
    English version up-to-date is already quite a task)
  

2020-03-05-17.53
  - no more waiting for the zip file to be created :)

2020-02-11-16.11
  - added: A settings file will be saved with all taken photos containing
    all routine and camera parameters (included in zip)
  - added: upload a setting file with parameters from past routines
  - added: support button (buy me a coffee :))
  - changed: spacing and padding of all UI elements to fit smaller screens

2020-02-04-10.50

  - fixed: zip file is only shown, when it is ready
  - fixed: status "--ready--" appeared to early, when routine was not done
